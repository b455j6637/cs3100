Extend your first Mandelbrot program to use multiple threads to speed up computation.

Include a short (1-2 paragraph) written report about your findings. This report must include speed up and efficiency calculations.

The ability to time the program with different numbers of computational threads and the computation of speed up will be used in future programs, so make it as generic as possible.
